    Analyst->>Assistant: /triage-alert CASE_ID=1234

    %% Step 1: Gather Initial Context
    Assistant->>SOAR: get_case_full_details(case_id)
    SOAR-->>Assistant: Case metadata, severity, entities
    Assistant->>SOAR: list_alerts_by_case(case_id)
    SOAR-->>Assistant: Alert list
    Assistant->>SOAR: list_events_by_alert(alert_id)
    SOAR-->>Assistant: Triggering events

    Note over Assistant: Extract KEY_ENTITIES (IPs, domains, hashes, users)

    %% Step 2: Check for Duplicates
    Assistant->>SOAR: siemplify_get_similar_cases(case_id)
    SOAR-->>Assistant: Similar case IDs

    alt Duplicate Confirmed
        Assistant->>SOAR: post_case_comment("Closing as duplicate...")
        Assistant->>SOAR: siemplify_close_case(reason=NOT_MALICIOUS)
        Assistant->>Analyst: Triage Complete (Duplicate)
    end

    %% Step 3: Find Related Cases
    Assistant->>SOAR: list_cases(search=KEY_ENTITIES, status="Opened")
    SOAR-->>Assistant: Related open cases

    %% Step 4: Alert-Specific SIEM Search
    Note over Assistant: Construct query based on alert type
    Assistant->>SIEM: search_security_events(query, hours_back=1)
    SIEM-->>Assistant: Initial SIEM context

    %% Step 5: Enrich Key Entities
    loop For each entity in KEY_ENTITIES
        alt IP Address
            Assistant->>GTI: get_ip_address_report(ip)
        else Domain
            Assistant->>GTI: get_domain_report(domain)
        else File Hash
            Assistant->>GTI: get_file_report(hash)
        else URL
            Assistant->>GTI: get_url_report(url)
        end
        GTI-->>Assistant: Threat intelligence data

        Assistant->>SIEM: lookup_entity(entity)
        SIEM-->>Assistant: Entity summary
        Assistant->>SIEM: get_ioc_matches(hours_back=96)
        SIEM-->>Assistant: IOC match status
    end

    %% Step 6-7: Assessment and Action
    Note over Assistant: Synthesize findings, make assessment

    alt False Positive / Benign True Positive
        Assistant->>SOAR: post_case_comment("Closing as FP/BTP: [rationale]")
        Assistant->>SOAR: siemplify_close_case(reason=NOT_MALICIOUS, root_cause=...)
        Assistant->>Analyst: Triage Complete (Closed)
    else True Positive / Suspicious
        Assistant->>SOAR: change_case_priority(priority=HIGH)
        Assistant->>SOAR: post_case_comment("Initial findings: [summary]")
        Assistant->>Analyst: Triage Complete (Escalated)
    end
```

## Completion Criteria

The triage is complete when:

- [ ] Alert has been thoroughly assessed using available enrichment data
- [ ] Duplicate check completed and documented
- [ ] Alert-specific SIEM search performed for immediate context
- [ ] Basic enrichment completed for all key entities
- [ ] Assessment decision made (FP/BTP/TP/Suspicious) with clear rationale
- [ ] Findings properly documented in SOAR with detailed comments
- [ ] Alert either closed with appropriate reason/root cause or escalated to next tier
- [ ] If escalated, relevant investigation runbook triggered or analyst assigned
- [ ] All actions and decisions logged in case comments for audit trail

## Expected Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Alert Status | Closed (with reason) or escalated for further investigation |
| Assessment Classification | False Positive (FP), Benign True Positive (BTP), True Positive (TP), or Suspicious |
| Documentation | Comprehensive case comments including enrichment findings, duplicate check results, assessment rationale, and next steps |
| Escalation Info | (if applicable) Priority adjustment, assignment details, triggered runbook references |
| Audit Trail | Complete record of all tools used, searches performed, and decisions made |

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Context & Duplicates (20 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Initial Context | 10 | Did the AI Assistant retrieve full details for the case/alert? |
| Duplicate Check | 10 | Did the AI Assistant correctly check for and handle duplicates? |

### 2. Analysis & Enrichment (30 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| SIEM Context | 15 | Did the AI Assistant perform a targeted SIEM search relevant to the alert type? |
| Entity Enrichment | 15 | Did the AI Assistant enrich key entities using GTI and/or SIEM lookups? |

### 3. Assessment & Decision (20 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Classification | 10 | Did the AI Assistant make a clear determination (FP/BTP/TP) supported by evidence? |
| Documentation | 10 | Did the AI Assistant document findings and rationale in SOAR case comments? |

### 4. Visual Summary (10 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Sequence Diagram | 10 | Did the AI Assistant produce a valid Mermaid sequence diagram of actions taken? |

### 5. Operational Metadata (10 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Date/Time | 5 | Did the AI Assistant record the date and time of execution? |
| Cost/Runtime | 5 | Did the AI Assistant attempt to record token usage and runtime duration? |

### 6. Resilience & Quality (10 Points)

| Criterion | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Error Handling | 5 | Did the AI Assistant handle tool failures gracefully without hallucinating? |
| Output Formatting | 5 | Is the final output well-structured and clean? |

### Critical Failures (Automatic Failure)

These errors result in automatic failure regardless of other scores:

- **Closing a True Positive as False Positive** - Missing a real threat
- **Failing to check for duplicates** - Wasting resources on already-investigated alerts
- **Hallucinating evidence** - Fabricating findings to support a closure decision

## Alert Type Quick Reference

### Suspicious Login Alerts
- Search for: Login events (success/failure) for user and source IP
- Time window: Around alert time (1 hour)
- Key indicators: Geographic anomalies, impossible travel, brute force patterns

### Malware Detection Alerts
- Search for: Process execution, file modifications, network connections
- Correlate: File hash, endpoint hostname, parent processes
- Key indicators: Known malware signatures, suspicious behaviors, C2 communication

### Network Alerts
- Search for: Network flows, DNS lookups, connection patterns
- Correlate: Source/destination IPs, domains, ports
- Key indicators: Known malicious IPs/domains, unusual traffic volumes, beaconing
